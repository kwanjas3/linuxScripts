sed command default prints all lines in the file you are looking in
to prevent duplicate use -n option

sed -n '[line numbers range seperated by comma/ string with /string/] mode' file

ex.

sed -n '3,5 p' cars
prints lines 3-5 from file cars

sed -n '/[Cc]hevy q' cars
prints first line instance of Chevy or chevy then quits from file cars

awk is similar to sed however the command defaults to print and is in {}

awk 's/hello/hi {print 3,4}' cars
substitutes hello string with hi in lines 3 and 4 from file cars

awk -F":" '{print $3} cars
sets delimiter to : and prints only field 3 from in file cars
